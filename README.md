# The Conventional Commits Specification 
[source](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

## Commit Message Structure

The commit message should be structured as follows:

- `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- `[optional body]`
- `[optional footer(s)]`

## Structural Elements

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- `fix`: a commit of the type `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- `feat`: a commit of the type `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
- Types other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example `@commitlint/config-conventional` (based on the Angular convention) recommends `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
- Footers other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

## Additional Types and Scope

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parentheses, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.
